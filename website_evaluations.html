    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <div>
        <a Target="_blank" href="https://www.tesla.com"><p style="color:black; font-size: 20px;">Tesla.com</p></a>
        <p>The website above is the Tesla website. It is a automotive and energy company. Tesla designs, manufactures,and sells electric vehicles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast - visually appealing </li>
            <li>Repetition - similar things do not look differnt</li>
            <li>Alignment - nothing looks out of place</li>
            <li>Proximity - infortmation and content is not spread throughout the page randomly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The website has really good contrast because various elements of the page are different and stand out. It does a good job by hiding less important information by using plain small text. It emphasizes important information with big titles and thicker fonts that stand out.
        The website uses great repetition to showcase each of their featured cars.The repetition is used to show the company name along with the model of the car. Below a nice high quality picture of the vehicle is shown. The allignment is great because nothing looks out of place. The allignment allows the website to look well put 
    together and professional. The proximity only adds to the aesthetic of the webpage because it groups related information close together. This allows the site to have various sections that have a similar theme for each category the company is trying to advertise. Overall this is a really good website.</p>

    <div>
        <a Target="_blank" href="https://www.art.yale.edu"><p style="color:black; font-size: 20px;">Yale School of Art: https://www.art.yale.edu</p></a>
        <p>The website above is called Yale School of art. It is a graduate school website that focuses on the Masters in Fine Arts in Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture. This website offers undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students. The website serves as an ongoing collaborative digital experiment. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast - this website is not visually appealing </li>
            <li>Repetition - similar look differnt, there is no theme and everything looks random.</li>
            <li>Alignment - everything looks out of place</li>
            <li>Proximity - information is spread throughout the page randomly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The website has really bad contrast because it highlights and makes unimportant stand out. There is too much random contrast that has no significance. The repitition is bad as well because there are not alot of things that are similar and prevents the website from having flow.
             There are random bolded fonts, and almost all text has a background color. Some text have background borders and some do not have borders at all. The aligment is okay. Most of the page is aligned left but there are parts of the page that look unaligned or off-centered. The proximity is not great because similar content is not grouped together. Information is scattered randomly throughout the page. There is not good color scheme because you can see neon green, orange, and yellow make the pages less visually appealing. Overall website is horrible and nothing makes sense when you look at the page.</p>
